Brain Dumps is literally what it says - Brain Dump of ideas and thoughts that come to me. Before I started working at Protegrity, I was active on the blogging scene under my parenting blog - www.curiousmumma.com. Unfortunately due to changing priorities, I failed to retain the domain and also backup of my posts!

Life just went about, working, attending PTMs, managing the house albeit with some help :), but it was not until November last year, 2020, that I realized what was missing as part of my life - an outlet for my thoughts and opinions!

So, let me welcome you to this blog and I hope you find something that helps or resonates with you.

This site is created using Hugo, GitHub, and Netlify. The links to what helped me set up are as follows -
