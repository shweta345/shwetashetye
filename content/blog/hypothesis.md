Reviewing documentation is a crucial step of any writing process. You can review your own work and reflect, or sometimes 
reach out to someone who can make this process easier. With an integration of MS office and Adobe Acrobat, you can churn out a decent enough document to send out to the world, but the assumption here would be that everyone has a similar setup. 
If your reviewers are connected to the internet and the documents are available for review online, Hypothesis can actually make
the process of reviewing and aggregating comments a lot easier. 

Hypothesis is described as follows on the site:
"Hypothesis is a new effort to implement an old idea: A conversation layer over the entire web that works everywhere, without needing implementation by any underlying site."

It is mostly marketed for a more learning environment and collaborative tool. From a technical writing perspective, we do use review and engage collaboratively with diverse set of stakeholders. Though the scope isn't specifically learning or is it (maybe), the scope definitely is to transparently review, engage, and collaborate. 

Reading through the features, I thought of testing it out on two setups. 

- Firstly, using the Chrome extension
- Secondly, integrating it as part of the Hugo site setup

At my current organization, we do not expose our documentation as part of the public domain. So, the second part of the experiment is more so from a perspective of such documentation teams.
