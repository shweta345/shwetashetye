# Experience Profile

Working as a Technical Writer since past 10 years, I have seen the industry evolve from being a very DITA-centric closed group of documentation experts to startups that don't want to wade through the details of DITA-OT and other integrations and want the results now!

I am proud to have been part of the journey from XML editing and complex DITA publishing systems to understanding nuances of creating simple, collaborative, and faster to market documentation setups.
